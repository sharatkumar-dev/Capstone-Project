An enterprise-grade, agentic AI compliance assistant designed to help **Independent Contractors (Sec 44ADA)** and **Small Businesses (Sec 44AD)** in India automate presumptive tax calculations. It dynamically guides users through tax onboarding, ingests invoices/receipts using multimodal vision parsing, organizes a bookkeeping ledger, and generates audit-ready compliance reports.

## 🏗️ Multi-Agent Architecture

The application is powered by an orchestrator coordinating three specialized agents:

```

### 1. 👤 Router Agent (CA Alok)
- **File**: [`agents/router_agent.py`](agents/router_agent.py)
- **Role**: Onboard the taxpayer and dynamically build a validated user profile.
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash` with Pydantic-enforced structured outputs.
- **Details**: Captures taxpayer name, assessment year, presumptive tax track (Professional vs. Small Business), gross turnover, and GST registration details (including GSTIN).

### 2. 👁️ Vision Agent (Document Parser)
- **File**: [`agents/vision_agent.py`](agents/vision_agent.py)
- **Role**: Ingestion and automated OCR of receipts and invoices.
- **Model**: Multimodal `gemini-2.0-flash`.
- **Details**: Detects PDF and image uploads, converts files, extracts transaction details (date, vendor, amount, GST component, GST rate, payment mode), and performs automated tax classification (e.g. Pure Business, Pure Personal, Mixed, Unresolved).

### 3. 🧮 Calculator Agent
- **File**: [`agents/calculator_agent.py`](agents/calculator_agent.py)
- **Role**: Mathematical rules engine and professional report generation.
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash`.
- **Details**: 
  - Verifies statutory caps (₹75 Lakhs under Sec 44ADA for Professionals; ₹3 Crores under Sec 44AD for Businesses).
  - Performs presumptive tax rules (50% flat income for professionals; 6% on digital turnover and 8% on cash turnover for small businesses).
  - Compiles a robust, audit-ready PDF/Markdown tax report detailing eligible Input Tax Credits (ITC) and net tax liabilities.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (required by `pdf2image` for PDF rendering)
  - **macOS**: `brew install poppler`
  - **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
  - **Windows**: Download binaries and add them to your system PATH.

### 1. Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharatkumar-dev/Capstone-Project.git
cd Capstone-Project
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### 3. Run the App
Launch the Streamlit web interface:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

The application includes a production-ready, multi-stage `Dockerfile` configured to run headlessly on Cloud Run or any container registry.

### Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t presumptive-tax-assistant .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Ensure you pass your Gemini API key as an environment variable:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here" presumptive-tax-assistant
```
The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## 🛡️ Data Privacy & Security
- **Secrets Management**: Secrets and API keys are strictly loaded via `.env` files and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
- **Statutory Limits Compliance**: The agent checks for gross revenue limits and refuses computation if standard limits (e.g. ₹75L / ₹3Cr) are breached, warning users that a mandatory **Section 44AB** audit is required.
